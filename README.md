# CIS3515_Lab_2
Create app that allows for and checks user input data

What is CIS3515_Lab_2?
This lab allowed us to practice using Android Studios by building another app. This app allowed users to input their name, 
email, a password and a password confirmation. There was also a clickable button that is used to confirm all data and send
a confirmation message when all fields were correctly completed. 

How does CIS3515_Lab_2 work?
The app works by simply lauching it. When it loads the screen shows instructions and all the fields required to fill out
have what data needs to be input inside the individual boxes. At the bottom of all the boxes is the Register button. When
this button is clicked it checks to make sure all fields are filled out and checks the password against the password con-
firmation field. If there are mistakes, a toask pops up indicating so. If there are no errors there is a success toast
message. 

Who uses CIS3515_Lab_2?
This app will be used by the TA to grade how we did. If this were implemented in the future to a larger app, this could 
be a part of a login to a larger application. In which case this would be used by any members of whatever you are logging
into. 

What is CIS3515_Lab_2â€™ goal?
The goal of this app is to get the students practice using the software and practice applying logic to solve problems.
